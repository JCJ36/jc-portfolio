            In more personal and less professional environments, I am not the most social person and don't actively talk 
            to people. Usually I word out my sentences in a way where it ends a conversation quickly.

            My hobbies are mostly listening to music and playing video games. In regards to music I don't judge on genre, 
            if I think it sounds good, then it sounds good. Favorite Genre though is EDM.

            In video games, I mentioned that my passion rooted from solving the small inconveniences in software, that all 
            started with video games. Of course it has now expanded to more than just video games but I won't let go 
            how inconveniences from there led me to what I now plan to major. <br />
            Anyways, my favorite genres in games really vary, like with music, I don't judge on genre, if I think its fun 
            then it's fun. 
            <br/>Main genres of video games are usually strategy games.
